# What is Helper?
Helper is a Online plateform where consumers can post their requirements, including the scope of the project, budget, location, timeline, and other relevant details. 
Contractors can then review the project details and submit their proposals or bids, outlining their services, prices, experience, and qualifications.
The platform typically facilitates communication between the consumer and contractor and helps both parties to negotiate and finalize the terms of the contract.
